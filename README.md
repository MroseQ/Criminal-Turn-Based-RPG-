   ![Intro](https://github.com/MroseQ/Criminal-Turn-Based-RPG-/assets/46853552/5c73b277-4ea8-43cb-917e-f7a1f74229c1)
   
   The game has two sides fighting each other: Player characters (Left side) and Enemy characters (Right side).
   To win the game, you need to eliminate every enemy (reduce their Health Bar to 0) without losing all Health Points on every one of your characters.
   Every character has its own Health Bar and Mana Bar visible on the upper part of the scene.
   Every character must select a skill they want to use on their turn. 
   Some skills have their Mana Cost (which will reduce the character's Mana Points) and/or have their Skill Cooldown (the number of turns that the character must wait before using the skill again).
   Some skills may require additional information about the target on which the skill should be used. To provide this information, the player should click two times on a target.
